Example for one of my tutorials at http://blog.robinchutaux.com/blog/a-smart-way-to-use-retrofit/

[Retrofit library](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) is a type-safe REST client for Android and Java created by [Square Open Source.](http://square.github.io/) With this library you can request the webservices of a REST api with POST, GET and more. This library is awesome and very useful, but you need a good architecture and a good practice to use it as best as possible.
